**Single purpose and small** distributed locking library for JVM. Provides multiple implementations (over single abstraction) for distributed locking:
- [mongo-synchronous](./mongo/sync) - uses mongodb (tested on v3.4) and its synchronous connector to manage locks
- [mongo-reactive](./mongo/reactive) - uses mongodb (tested on v3.4) and its reactive connector to manage locks
- ...postgres implementation comes next

Before using the library read about [main problems of distributed locking](#disclaimer).

## Basic usage

### Synchronous usage

Add dependency to `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile "com.coditory.sherlock:sherlock-mongo-sync:0.1.12"
}
```

Create synchronous lock:
```java
// Initialize Sherlock
String database = "sherlock";
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017/" + database);
Sherlock sherlock = MongoSherlock.builder()
    .withMongoClient(mongoClient) // required
    .withDatabaseName(database) // required
    .withClock(Clock.systemDefaultZone()) // default: Clock.systemDefaultZone()
    .withCollectionName("locks") // default: "locks"
    .withLockDuration(Duration.ofMinutes(5)) // default: 5 min
    .withOwnerId("datacenter-X-machine-Y-instance-Z") // default: generated unique string
    .build();
// Create a lock
DistributedLock lock = sherlock.createLock("sample-lock");
```

Acquire a lock:
```java
// Acquire a lock
if (lock.acquire()) {
  try {
    System.out.println("Lock granted!");
  } finally {
    lock.release();
  }
}
```

...or acquire a lock in a less verbose way:
```java
lock.acquireAndExecute(() -> {
  System.out.println("Lock granted!");
});
```

### Reactive usage

Add dependency to `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile "com.coditory.sherlock:sherlock-mongo-reactive:0.1.12"
  compile "com.coditory.sherlock:sherlock-reactor:0.1.12"
}
```

Create synchronous lock:
```java
// Initialize Sherlock
String database = "sherlock";
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017/" + database);
ReactorSherlock sherlock = ReactiveMongoSherlock.builder()
  .withMongoClient(mongoClient)
  .withDatabaseName(database)
  .build()
  .map(ReactorSherlock::reactorSherlock);
// Create a lock
ReactorDistributedLock lock = sherlock.createLock("sample-lock");
```

Acquire a lock:
```java
// Acquire a lock
lock.acquire()
  .filter(LockResult::isLocked)
  .flatMap(result -> {
    System.out.println("Lock granted!");
    return lock.release();
  })
  .block();
```

...or shorter
```java
lock.acquireAndExecute(() -> Mono.just("Lock granted!"))
  .block();
```

## Lock duration

There are 3 methods for acquiring a lock:
- `lock.acquire()` - acquires lock for a default duration (5 minutes) after which lock is automatically released
- `lock.acquire(Duration.ofMinutes(3))` - acquires a lock for a specific duration
- `lock.acquireForever()` - acquires a lock forever. Use it wisely.

## Lock types

There are 3 types of locks:
- `SingleEntrantDistributedLock` - lock owner cannot acquire the same lock for the second time
- `ReentrantDistributedLock` - lock owner can acquire the same lock multiple times
- `OverridingDistributedLock` - lock that acquires and releases the lock with `sudo` rights

`SingleEntrantDistributedLock` and `ReentrantDistributedLock` handles the problem of [releasing a lock](#disclaimer) by using an expiration mechanism.

`OverridingDistributedLock` was created for purely administrative tasks.

### Acquiring a lock by different lock types

`SingleEntrantDistributedLock`
```java
DistributedLock lock = sherlock.createLock("single-entrant");
Instance A                     | Instance B
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
                               | assert lock.lock() == false
assert lock.acquire() == false;|
```

`ReentrantDistributedLock`
```java
DistributedLock lock = sherlock.createReentrantLock("reentrant");
Instance A                     | Instance B
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
                               | assert lock.lock() == false
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
```

`OverridingDistributedLock`
```java
DistributedLock lock = sherlock.createOverridingLock("overriding");
Instance A                     | Instance B
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
                               | assert lock.lock() == true
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
```

### Releasing a lock by different lock types

`SingleEntrantDistributedLock` and `ReentrantDistributedLock`
```java
Instance A                     | Instance B
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
                               | assert lock.lock() == false
                               | assert lock.release() == false
assert lock.release() == true; |
assert lock.release() == false;|
```

`OverridingDistributedLock`
```java
Instance A                     | Instance B
assert lock.acquire() == true; |
                               | assert lock.lock() == true
                               | assert lock.release() == true
assert lock.release() == false;|
assert lock.release() == false;|
```

## Lock state in storage
In mongo distributed lock implementation, lock is stored as a document:

```json
{
  "_id": "lock-id",
  "acquiredBy": "service-instance-id",
  "acquiredAt": { "$date": 1562502838189 },
  "expiresAt": { "$date": 1562503458189 }
}
```

## Testability

For easy stubbing and mocking all exposed
api uses interfaces (see: `Sherlock`, `ReactorSherlock`, `DistributedLock`, `ReactorDistributedLock`).

Exposed interfaces have already stubs or mocks prepared. See:
`SherlockStub`, `ReactorSherlockStub`, `DistributedLockMock` and `ReactorDistributedLockMock`.

Sample usage in spock tests:

```groovy
def "should release a lock after operation"() {
  given: "there is a released lock"
    DistributedLockMock lock = DistributedLockMock.alwaysReleasedLock()
  when: "single instance action is executed"
    boolean taskPerformed = singleInstanceAction(lock)
  then: "the task was performed"
    taskPerformed == true
  and: "lock was acquired and released"
    lock.wasAcquiredAndReleased == true
}

def "should not perform single instance action when lock is locked"() {
  given: "there is a lock acquired by other instance"
    DistributedLockMock lock = DistributedLockMock.alwaysAcquiredLock()
  when: "single instance action is executed"
    boolean taskPerformed = singleInstanceAction(lock)
  then: "action did not perform the task"
    taskPerformed == false
  and: "action failed acquiring the lock"
    lock.wasAcquireRejected == true
  and: "action did not release the lock"
    lock.wasReleaseInvoked == false
}
```

## Problems of distributed locking

Distributed locking is not a trivial concept. Before using it know its limits.

#### How to ensure that a that was acquired lock will be release?

It is possible the an instance that acquired a lock may go down before releasing it. Example:

```java
if (lock.acquire()) {
  try {
    System.out.println("Lock granted!");
    System.exit(); // ...or OOM or any other cause
  } finally {
    // this part is never reached
    lock.release();
  }
}
```

This problem is fixed by [automatically releasing a lock](#lock-duration) after expiration time.

#### How to ensure that an operation did not exceed a lock duration?**
Because of stop-the-world (...or multiple other causes) an operation that required a lock may
take longer to finish than the lock duration. Example:

```java
if (lock.acquire()) {
  try {
    System.out.println("Lock granted!");
    System.gc(); // ...very long break that exceeded lock duration
    criticalAction(); // invoked by two instances
  } finally {
    lock.release();
  }
}
```

This problem is well described by [Martin Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html).

This library is not designed to solve it. Simply make the lock duration as long as possible and don't use it in a per request manner.
